Instead of using Pololu/microcontroller libraries directly, create a header file with generic functions specific to our application (e.g. read_line_sensor(int n), start_wheels(int n)).
All code makes calls to this intermediate library.
Then 2 versions of the library are made: one that runs on the robot and makes Pololu calls and one that runs on a simulator which simulates a little robot.


main
	- start the robot/simulator threads
robot
	- single functions which contain infinite loops that contain all robot-logic
robot-api
	- contain proxy functions which either call Pololu functions or simulator functions depending on which system the robot is being compiled for
simulator
	- contains everything necessary to for the simulator (OpenGL)
